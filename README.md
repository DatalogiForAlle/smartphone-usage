# Detect Smartphone usage
The purpose of this project is to teach kids about privacy and data
analysis, by allowing them to develop a smartwatch that can monitor
their parents use of their smartphone.

The kids will both do data collection (motion sensor data + button
presses), data analysis (at what angles of the sensor, does it seem
like the smartphone is used?), discuss privacy issues and general
usability of the watch.


## Hardware
Currently we use an M5StickC as it comes with both a motion sensor and
a wristband making it easy to do smartwatch style projects.
